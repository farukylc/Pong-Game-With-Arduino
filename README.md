# Pong Game With Arduino

# Introduction:


In this project my aim was creating the classic **PONG** game with Arduino. “**Pong** is a [table tennis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis "Table tennis")–themed [twitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_gameplay "Twitch gameplay") arcade [sports video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_video_game "Sports video game"), featuring simple [two-dimensional graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics "2D computer graphics"), manufactured by [Atari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari,_Inc "Atari, Inc") and originally released in 1972.”.

“**Pong** is a two-dimensional sports game]that simulates [table tennis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis "Table tennis"). The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.”

<ins> I finished this project for my  **Microproccessor** Lecture (**COME322/1**). **I got lots of help from the project which you can access via this [link](https://www.instructables.com/8x16-LED-Matrix-Pong-Game-2-Paddles-Per-Player-Ver/)**. I added some features to this project such as saving the score and the date when the game played. </ins>
